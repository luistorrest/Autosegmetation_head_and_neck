# Autosegmentation for Head and neck CT images

In this repository there is a python code, where computed tomography images are analyzed, to segment the organs contained in the head and neck, using convolutional neural networks using a semantic PyTorch segmentation model (SMP) with a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) architecture.

The code is implemented using [Notebook Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1YkekeE8IHGkYqGHtPnhQ1JKTlPc_wosS?authuser=2#scrollTo=K6gH5xpl7F4h)

To clone the repository is used: 

`git clone: git@github.com:luistorrest/Autosegmetation_head_and_neck.git`
